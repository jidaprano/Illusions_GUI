Listen to the tone. What do you feel? 

A Shepard tone sounds like a continuously rising tone. It is made by playing a scale in many octaves at the same time. Your brain combines all the tones it hears, and you perceive one continuously rising tone. Suspense music in movies sometimes uses a Shepard tone.

What do you see as you watch the dots move? Do you see the circle moving as one object or as individual dots moving in straight lines? 

Each dot is moving in a straight line at a constant speed. Focusing on one dot makes this clear, but viewing the dots as a single object makes it look like a spinning circle. This demonstrates how the brain can automatically group similar objects into one object based on similarity, continuity, and proximity.

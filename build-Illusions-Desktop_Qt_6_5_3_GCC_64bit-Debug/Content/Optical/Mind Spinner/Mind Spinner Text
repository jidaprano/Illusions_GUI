How does the wheel move? 

It appears to be turning, but it's actually just two alternating images switching which tiles are black and which are white. Test it by making the wheel turn one way or the other just by thinking about it. This is an example of how our brains use light to perceive movement. When something bright appears in one location and then another, we interpret this as movement. This is an example of a motion ambiguity illusion.

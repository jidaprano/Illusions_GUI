Did you see the ballâ€™s movement as rolling or bouncing? 

Your brain uses many cues to reconstruct a 3D image based on what our eyes see. One visual cue your brain relies on to estimate depth and motion is shadow. When the shadow moves away from the ball, the ball appears to rise. When the shadow stays on the ball, the ball appears to roll instead. The ball is moving the exact same each time.

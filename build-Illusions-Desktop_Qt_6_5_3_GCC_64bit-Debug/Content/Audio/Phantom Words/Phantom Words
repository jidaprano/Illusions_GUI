Listen to the recording. Do you hear any words? Have someone else listen too. Do they hear different words?
 
There are actually no words in this recording - just noises close to words. Our brains are trained to interpret sound into meaning, so we begin to hear words emerge. But the words you hear might not be what someone else hears. What you hear depends on your background and even how you feel right now.
 Words reported: window, welcome, melting, love me, run away, no brain, no way, raincoat.
